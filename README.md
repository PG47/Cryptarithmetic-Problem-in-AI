"# Cryptarithmetic-Problem-in-AI" 
Cryptarithmetic Problem is a type of constraint satisfaction problem where the game is
about digits and its unique replacement either with alphabets or other symbols. In
cryptarithmetic problem, the digits (0-9) get substituted by some possible alphabets or
symbols. The task in cryptarithmetic problem is to substitute each digit with an alphabet
to get the result arithmetically correct.
In Google Play, you can find some game with cryptarithmetic puzzle. The Cryptogram is
an example. You can enjoy it for some early experience but not be immersed in it.

In this project, I created 2 files to solve this Cryptarithmetic Problem in 2 level:
+ Level 1: Solve the addition equation or subtraction equation with 2 operands
Ex: SEND+MORE=MONEY

+ Level 2: Solve any kind of equation with multiple operands and single operator (+,-).
Ex:SO+MANY+MORE+MEN+SEEM+TO+SAY+THAT+THEY+MAY+SOON+TRY+TO+STAY+AT+HOME+SO+AS+TO+SEE+OR+HEAR+THE+SAME+ONE+MAN+TRY+TO+MEET+THE+TEAM+ON+THE+MOON+AS+HE+HAS+AT+THE+OTHER+TEN=TESTS
The answer is that TRANHYSMOE=9876543210
